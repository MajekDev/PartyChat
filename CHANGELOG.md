# 4.2.0 - Bye Bye AnvilGUI

- Drop support for AnvilGUI in favor of typing the input in chat.
- Add GitHub workflows for build and publish.
- Add issue templates.
- Fix bug with `/party kick`.
- Add JavaDocs to main branch in /docs.
- Move to new (better) ConfigUpdater via Maven.

AnvilGUI was a really cool thing, it just introduced too many bugs with all the different versions of Minecraft 
we're supporting. It may be added back at a later date but as of right now it's not worth all the bugs it caused.
